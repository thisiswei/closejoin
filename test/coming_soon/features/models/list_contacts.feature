Feature: Listing Contacts

  Background:
    Given there are no contacts
    And the contact count is 0
    And I add a contact for "zuck@facebook.com" with a referrer from "http://facebook.com/cool-stuff"
    And I delay a moment
    And I add a contact for "obama@whitehouse.gov" with a referrer from "http://cia.gov/secret-stuff"
    And I delay a moment
    And I add a contact for "biden@whitehouse.gov" with a referrer from "http://cia.gov/secret-stuff"
    And I delay a moment
    And I add a contact for "jonny@apple.com"
    And now the contact count is 4
    And the content store is sane

  Scenario: Listing all contacts in collected at order

    And the next contact is "obama@whitehouse.gov" with the id 2 and the referrer "http://cia.gov/secret-stuff"
